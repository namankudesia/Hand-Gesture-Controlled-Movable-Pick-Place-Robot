# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Movable-Pick-Place-Robot

Designed and developed a sophisticated 

robotic system using Java programming and Arduino microcontroller technology. This system enables precise pick and 

place operations controlled via accelerometer-based hand gestures. Implemented a Transmitter-Receiver system: the 

Transmitter interpreted hand gestures received by the Receiver for precise object handling and placement. Integrated 

advanced IoT capabilities for remote operation and applied cutting-edge AI/ML and robotics techniques to enhance 

gesture recognition accuracy. Implemented servo motors to enable four degrees of freedom in the robotic arm, optimizing 

industrial automation processes with intuitive and efficient control methods.
